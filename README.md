# COVID-19 Global Trends Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive data analysis and reporting notebook that tracks global COVID-19 trends. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, learners will import, clean, and explore real-world COVID-19 data, generate insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualize key metrics like cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and over time.

## 📋 Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+ installed
* Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
* Required Python libraries:

  * pandas
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn
  * plotly (optional for maps)
  * geopandas (optional for advanced mapping)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   ```

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/covid19-trends.git](https://github.com/your-username/covid19-trends.git)
cd covid19-trends

````
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

3. **Download the data**

   * Place `owid-covid-data.csv` in the `data/` folder.

4. **Launch the notebook**

   ```bash
   ```

jupyter notebook notebooks/covid\_analysis.ipynb

```

## 🧩 Segments Overview

### 1️⃣ Data Collection
- Source: Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset (CSV)
- Action: Save the CSV in `data/` for easy loading with pandas.

### 2️⃣ Data Loading & Exploration
- Load data: `df = pd.read_csv('data/owid-covid-data.csv')`
- Inspect structure: `df.head()`, `df.columns`, `df.isnull().sum()`

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Filter for selected countries (e.g., Kenya, USA, India)
- Convert `date` column to datetime
- Handle missing values via `dropna()` or `interpolate()`

### 4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Line charts: total/new cases & deaths over time
- Bar charts: top countries by total cases
- Compute death rate: `total_deaths / total_cases`

### 5️⃣ Vaccination Trends
- Plot cumulative vaccinations per country
- Compare percent vaccinated of population

### 6️⃣ Optional: Choropleth Map
- Tools: Plotly Express or GeoPandas
- Visualize case density or vaccination rate by country

### 7️⃣ Insights & Reporting
- Summarize 3–5 key findings
- Use markdown for narrative explanations
- Export notebook to PDF or PowerPoint as needed

## 📊 Output & Deliverables

- Well-documented Jupyter Notebook with code, visuals, and narratives
- Exported report in PDF (or PowerPoint) format
- Charts and maps saved to `output/figures/`

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

- Comment your code for clarity
- Use functions to modularize repeated tasks
- Explore additional visualizations (heatmaps, scatter plots)
- Verify data quality at each step

*Happy analyzing!*
